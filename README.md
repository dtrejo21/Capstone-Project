They also want to prioritize their classes based off of when to complete. They're only interested in making sure they're completing their school assignments. May get overwhelmed with the website if there's too many features.

College Student, multiple features: Someone who wants to not only organize their tasks, but to also wants to have a customizable timer that allows implement the pomodoro method or be able to change it to any amount they want. While they know what workspace they want, having too many features to customize may lead them to change nothing.

College Student #2, loves data: Someone who wants to be able to keep track of how much time they spend on each task/assignment and how much time they spent on a class overall. Doesn't want to set breaks into the timer.
